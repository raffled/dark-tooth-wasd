# Darktooth WASD Keyboard layout design

This is a keyboard layout based on the Emacs theme, Darktooth created by [emacsfodder](https://github.com/emacsfodder).

For the original 104 key design, see his repository here: [https://github.com/emacsfodder/dark-tooth-wasd](https://github.com/emacsfodder/dark-tooth-wasd).

I've been replicating a similar design for an 87 key tenkeyless board.

Layout is Mac / ANSI. (Super = Cmd, Meta = Alt)

# Previews
